# Regression model to predict neurofeedback aptitude 
The code was developed to predict neurofeedback (NF) aptitude from the resting-state fuctional connectivity (rs-FC) before the NF training.
Given the rs-FC matrix and the corresponging NF aptitude score, the code will develop a regression model based on the PLS method with exhaustive search.
